# Tic-tac-toe 
1. This is a Java application based on reference from https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_TicTacToe.html.
2. Have perfomed some refractoring to the suggested implementation to enable MVC design pattern.
3. The game can now be implemented with any view implementations by implementing TicTacToeView interface.
